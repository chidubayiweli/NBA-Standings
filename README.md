This repository contains SQL-based analytics projects aimed at providing insights into NBA team and player performance. The projects focus on various aspects of game outcomes, including clutch performance, blowouts, and home vs. road performance. Each project uses data-driven approaches to rank and analyze teams based on specific performance metrics.

Clutch Performance Analysis

This analysis identifies which teams perform better in close games decided by 3 points or fewer. I calculated and compared the win-loss record of each team in these clutch situations, then ranked the teams based on their performance. 

Key Insights:
- The Los Angeles Lakers had the highest win percentage in games decided by 3 points or fewer.
- The New Orleans Pelicans struggled the most, losing 87% of their games decided by 3 points or fewer.

Blowout Analysis: Games Decided by 10 Points or More

This project focuses on identifying teams that consistently win by large margins or suffer blowout losses. I calculated the win percentage for games decided by 10 points or more and ranked teams based on their performance in these games.

Key Insights:
- The Boston Celtics dominated, winning the most games by 10 points or more during their championship-winning season.
- The Charlotte Hornets experienced the most blowout losses, highlighting their struggles in high-margin games.

Home vs. Road Performance Analysis

In this analysis, I calculated and compared the win percentages of teams playing at home versus on the road. This provides insight into which teams perform better in different environments.

Key Insights:
- The New Orleans Pelicans had the highest road win percentage, showing resilience away from home.
- The Boston Celtics led the league with the highest home win percentage, highlighting their strong home-court advantage. <br>
